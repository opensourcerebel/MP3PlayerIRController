After writing the above that I really think I have created a monster! :)

To compile and use one needs software:
- MPLABX IDE from Microchip
- HI-TECH PICC (v9.83 or above) Compiler from Microchip 
- AN1310 High Speed RS232 bootlader burned in to the chip
To compile and use one needs hardware:
- Michrochip PICKit3 to burn the AN1310 bootloader from Microchip
After that you can upload the HEX file to the chip without the need of programmer.
